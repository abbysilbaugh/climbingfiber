# Code used in Silbaugh et al. 2025

To generate all the figures from the publication, take the following steps:
1. Downlaod the dataset from Dryad (DOI: 10.5061/dryad.v41ns1sb2). This includes two-photon imaging data (climbingfiber_workspace.mat and 20230516_analysis.zip) and microscopy images (Image_files.zip); no need to download the microscopy images for the following steps.
2. Load climbingfiber_main.mat (alternatively, to generate the dataset, first unzip 20230516_analysis.zip into a folder called climbingfiber, which should also containin everything inside this repo. Then, run climbingfiber_main from within your climbingfiber folder)
3. Run climbingfiber_plots_main from within your climbingfiber folder. Breakpoints are recommended.

MATLAB version 2022a was used.
